<div class="content">
    <p>Growing up, I always loved walking by the windows of bridal shops. Looking at all the beautiful gowns, I dreamt about
        the day when I would be the one walking down the aisle. I remember drawing my own wedding gown - I always pictured it to be a real princess dress with lots of
        tulle layers. However, when that day finally come years later, I wanted something different. Yes, I still wanted a gown in which I would feel like a princess, but I wanted it to be much more minimalistic.
        I started searching for dresses, but no matter how hard I tried, I simply just could not find a dress that suited my taste. Therefore, I decided to make my own wedding gown from scratch.
        It became exactly what I wanted - a timeless, chic dress with that little <em>extra something</em>. When it was ready, it was love at first sight for me. And when I showed the dress to
        my friends and relatives, they all asked me where I got it from. That is when the idea of Amorée suddenly came to me.
